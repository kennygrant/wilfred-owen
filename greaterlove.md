# Greater Love  
  
Red lips are not so red  
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the stained stones kissed by the English dead.  
Kindness of wooed and wooer  
Seems shame to their love pure.  
O Love, your eyes lose lure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I behold eyes blinded in my stead!  
  
Your slender attitude  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed,  
Rolling and rolling there  
Where God seems not to care;  
Till the fierce Love they bear  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cramps them in death’s extreme decrepitude.  
  
Your voice sings not so soft,—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft,—  
Your dear voice is not dear,  
Gentle, and evening clear,  
As theirs whom none now hear  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed.  
  
Heart, you were never hot,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot;  
And though your hand be pale,  
Paler are all which trail  
Your cross through flame and hail:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep, you may weep, for you may touch them not.
