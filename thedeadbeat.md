# The Dead-Beat  
  
He dropped,—more sullenly than wearily,  
Lay stupid like a cod, heavy like meat,  
And none of us could kick him to his feet;  
Just blinked at my revolver, blearily;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;—Didn’t appear to know a war was on,  
Or see the blasted trench at which he stared.  
“I’ll do ‘em in,” he whined, “If this hand’s spared,  
I’ll murder them, I will.”  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A low voice said,  
“It’s Blighty, p’raps, he sees; his pluck’s all gone,  
Dreaming of all the valiant, that AREN’T dead:  
Bold uncles, smiling ministerially;  
Maybe his brave young wife, getting her fun  
In some new home, improved materially.  
It’s not these stiffs have crazed him; nor the Hun.”  
  
We sent him down at last, out of the way.  
Unwounded; – stout lad, too, before that strafe.  
Malingering?  Stretcher-bearers winked, “Not half!”  
  
Next day I heard the Doc’s well-whiskied laugh:  
“That scum you sent last night soon died.  Hooray!”
