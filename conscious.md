# Conscious  
  
His fingers wake, and flutter up the bed.  
His eyes come open with a pull of will,  
Helped by the yellow may-flowers by his head.  
A blind-cord drawls across the window-sill . . .  
How smooth the floor of the ward is! what a rug!  
And who’s that talking, somewhere out of sight?  
Why are they laughing?  What’s inside that jug?  
“Nurse!  Doctor!”  “Yes; all right, all right.”  
  
But sudden dusk bewilders all the air—  
There seems no time to want a drink of water.  
Nurse looks so far away.  And everywhere  
Music and roses burnt through crimson slaughter.  
Cold; cold; he’s cold; and yet so hot:  
And there’s no light to see the voices by—  
No time to dream, and ask—he knows not what.  
I Saw His Round Mouth’s Crimson  
  
I saw his round mouth’s crimson deepen as it fell,  
Like a Sun, in his last deep hour;  
Watched the magnificent recession of farewell,  
Clouding, half gleam, half glower,  
And a last splendour burn the heavens of his cheek.  
And in his eyes  
The cold stars lighting, very old and bleak,  
In different skies.
