Poetry from the First World War by Wilfred Owen

_"I came out in order to help these boys - directly by leading them as well as an officer can... indirectly, by watching their sufferings that I may speak as well as a pleader can."_

Wilfred Owen died on 4 November 1918, one week before the signing of the Armistice which ended the war.
