Poetry from the First World War by Wilfred Owen

A collection of poems by Wilfred Owen, including all his classic wartime poetry based on his experiences in World War I, and several poems not in the 1920s edition. Wilfred Owen died on 4 November 1918, one week before the signing of the Armistice which ended the war. In a letter written just before he died, he wrote:

_"I came out in order to help these boys - directly by leading them as well as an officer can... indirectly, by watching their sufferings that I may speak as well as a pleader can."_
