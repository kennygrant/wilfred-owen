# Apologia pro Poemate Meo  
  
I, too, saw God through mud—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;War brought more glory to their eyes than blood,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child.  
  
Merry it was to laugh there—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where death becomes absurd and life absurder.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;For power was on us as we slashed bones bare  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder.  
  
I, too, have dropped off fear—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sailed my spirit surging, light and clear  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the entanglement where hopes lay strewn;  
  
And witnessed exultation—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine and lift up with passion of oblation,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraphic for an hour; though they were foul.  
  
I have made fellowships—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Untold of happy lovers in old song.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love is not the binding of fair lips  
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,  
  
By Joy, whose ribbon slips,—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wound with war’s hard wire whose stakes are strong;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong.  
  
I have perceived much beauty  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard music in the silentness of duty;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate.  
  
Nevertheless, except you share  
&nbsp;&nbsp;With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose world is but the trembling of a flare,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heaven but as the highway for a shell,  
  
You shall not hear their mirth:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not come to think them well content  
&nbsp;&nbsp;By any jest of mine.  These men are worth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tears:  You are not worth their merriment.
