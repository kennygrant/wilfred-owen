# Anthem for Doomed Youth  
  
What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the monstrous anger of the guns.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the stuttering rifles’ rapid rattle  
Can patter out their hasty orisons.  
No mockeries for them; no prayers nor bells,  
Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,—  
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;  
And bugles calling for them from sad shires.  
  
What candles may be held to speed them all?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes  
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pallor of girls’ brows shall be their pall;  
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,  
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
