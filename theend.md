# The End  
  
After the blast of lightning from the east,  
The flourish of loud clouds, the Chariot throne,  
After the drums of time have rolled and ceased  
And from the bronze west long retreat is blown,  
  
Shall Life renew these bodies?  Of a truth  
All death will he annul, all tears assuage?  
Or fill these void veins full again with youth  
And wash with an immortal water age?  
  
When I do ask white Age, he saith not so,—  
“My head hangs weighed with snow.”  
And when I hearken to the Earth she saith  
My fiery heart sinks aching.  It is death.  
Mine ancient scars shall not be glorified  
Nor my titanic tears the seas be dried.”
